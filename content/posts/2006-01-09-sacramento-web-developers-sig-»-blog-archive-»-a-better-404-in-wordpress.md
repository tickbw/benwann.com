> When I think of handling 404 errors in the best way possible, there is no site that comes to my mind faster than [Mike Davidsonâ€™s][2]. I mean, heâ€™s got â€˜em nailed. Iâ€™m not going to link up a non-existent page on his site, but do yourself a favor (so weâ€™re all on the same page) and go try it out.

> Ok good, you see all that? He automatically does a search for what he thinks you were looking for. If only one result is returned from the search, he automatically sends you to that page. Even more, when a 404 happens you also get a search bar right at the top of the page with the guessed search term already filled in. Pretty. Pretty. Pretty good.
