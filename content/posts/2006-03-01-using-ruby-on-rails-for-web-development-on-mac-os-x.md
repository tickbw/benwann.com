[Using Ruby on Rails for Web Development on Mac OS X][1]

> Why Ruby on Rails?
> 
> First, you might be wondering: Web application frameworks are a dime a dozen, so what&#8217;s different about Rails? Here are a few things that make Ruby on Rails stand above the crowd:
> 
>   * Full-Stack Web Framework. Rails is an MVC web framework where models, views, and controllers are fully integrated in a seamless fashion. That means you automatically get all the benefits of an MVC design without the hassle of explicitly configuring each component to play well with the others.
>   * Real-World Usage. The Rails framework was extracted from real-world web applications. That is, Rails comes from real need, not anticipating what might be needed. The result is an easy to use and cohesive framework that&#8217;s rich in functionality, and at the same time it does its best to stay out of your way.
>   * One Language: Ruby. Everything from business logic to configuration files (there aren&#8217;t many) are written in the Ruby programming language. With just one language, you hope it&#8217;s a good one, and Ruby doesn&#8217;t disappoint. Ruby is a full object-oriented language with clean syntax and it has a way of making programming truly fun. Using one language means you don&#8217;t have to juggle between multiple languages and dialects as you&#8217;re building your application. 
>   * Convention over Configuration. Rails works hard to take care of all the repetitive and error-prone chores associated with starting to build a web application, and maintaining it over time. Rails uses simple naming conventions and clever use of reflection to make your work easier with near-zero configuration.
>   * It&#8217;s Productive! At the end of the day, Rails is all about helping you stay productive.
