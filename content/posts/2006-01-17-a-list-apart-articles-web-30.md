I love Jeffrey [Zeldman][1]. As a young and aspiring web developer, living rent check to rent check, I feel personally close to this article. Web 2.0 has been an interesting trend, much talked about, and yet hard to find or actually define. Read this article to find a particually well defined view of what the wrong version of Web 2.0 is. The web today will not be the same web tommorow. Business has been redefined by the internet, and those companies which don&#8217;t see that will get farther and farther behind. The concept of value though has not fundamentally changed. The internet does force

Without further ado, please, read this article, and become wise with the ways of Zeldman&#8230;.. and the force, when you get a chance.

> Some small teams of sharp peopleâ€”people who once, perhaps, worked for those with dimmer visionsâ€”are now following their own muses and designing smart web applications. Products like [Flickr][3] and [Basecamp][4] are fun and well-made and easy to use.

> That may not sound like much. But ours is a medium in which, more often than not, big teams have slowly and expensively labored to produce overly complex web applications whose usability was near nil on behalf of clients with at best vague goals. The realization that small, self-directed teams powered by [Paretoâ€™s Principle][5] can quickly create sleeker stuff that works better is not merely bracing but dynamic. As 100 garage bands sprang from every Velvet Underground record sold, so the realization that one small team can make good prompts 100 others to try.
