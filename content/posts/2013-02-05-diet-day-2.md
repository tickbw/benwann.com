Hard boiled eggs this am, ate two of em.  
Had grilled chicken for lunch and zucchini. Not enough water today, need to do better. 

Rachel made flank steak for dinner and also an awesome spinach salad. 

Did day 2 of 30 day shred, holy hell I just got hit by a Mack truck again, but feel much better today. Rachel and I did level 1 for 20 minutes, sweet lord that is hard when you are out of shape. Haven&#8217;t felt this out of shape since the early days of college football camp.
