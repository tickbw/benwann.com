Making a better iCal

A few days ago, Merlin Mann mentioned on his 43 Folders site that heâ€™d be interested in a small enhancement for iCal. Out of the box, iCal only adds an alarm to events if you manually add it &#8211; strange behavior, considering a calendar is the tool to alert us to upcoming events. He asked for automatic creation of those alarms.

At the same time, I was looking to delve a bit deeper into OSX programming. And it was also sufficiently small that I could turn it into an experiment on productivity.</p>
