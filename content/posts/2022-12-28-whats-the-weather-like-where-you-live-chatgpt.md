Imagine if it did! What inferences would it make as it took in inputs from our questions and formed its own opinions? I think that the creators of the AI&#8217;s we are starting to see today are purposely keeping these features turned off to prevent fear of AI from taking over, because it would start to really blur the lines in a digital era of &#8220;who am I talking to right now?&#8221; This is likely a good thing, but I wonder where the line will be drawn. Will it be a big blast, or will the creators start to blend it in over time? Keep your eye out for this.</figcaption></figure>
