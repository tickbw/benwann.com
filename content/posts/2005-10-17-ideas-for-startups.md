Just got done reading an article over Paul Graham&#8217;s site. Everytime I leave there, I get a little pick me up on the work that I am trying to do. DONT WORK FOR THE MAN! Gotta stick to that&#8230;.. Must stick to it&#8230;..  
Must form start-up company&#8230;&#8230; Must be bought so I can make more start-up companies.

Anyways here is the link to the article. ðŸ™‚

[Ideas for Startups][1]

> How do you get good ideas for startups? That&#8217;s probably the number one question people ask me.
> 
> I&#8217;d like to reply with another question: why do people think it&#8217;s hard to come up with ideas for startups?
> 
> That might seem a stupid thing to ask. Why do they think it&#8217;s hard? If people can&#8217;t do it, then it is hard, at least for them. Right?
