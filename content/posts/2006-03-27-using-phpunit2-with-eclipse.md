This is nice.

> UnitTesting has also become a valuable task to the serious PHP programmer. There is already a plugin for simpletest available to use in eclipse. Judging after the UI, it comes very close to JUnit. Unfortunately, there is no plugin for PHPUnit(2) available yet (although Sebastian stated earlier that Zend wants to take care of this for the upcoming ZendIDE). However, there is a way how you can integrate PHPUnit2 as an external tool into eclipse. Iâ€™ve done this on my Windows system at home, but you may be able to adopt this howto on a *nix machine, substituting the respective parameters with your target os pendants.
