In short this mean, &#8220;Where am I vulnerable.&#8221; It talks about how each of these 10 attack vectors can be exploited, and the best practice to accept in order to secure against its exploitation. Of course there is no silver bullet in web security, so it is really about finding out where you most vulnerable, and guarding the gate.</p>
