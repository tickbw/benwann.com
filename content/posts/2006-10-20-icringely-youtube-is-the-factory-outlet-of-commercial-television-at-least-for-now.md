I love Robert Cringely&#8217;s pulpit [column][1] at [PBS.org][2].  
He always has a depth to his analysis that I appreciate.

Last [week][3], he talked about YouTube because c&#8217;mon, WHO HASN&#8217;T! For crying out loud, my grandmother asked me about it. If there is anyone out there who says that YouTube isn&#8217;t a common household word, I challenge you!!! My grandmother knows about YouTube. I cant get over it. 

The most quoteable line from the article in my opinion is 

> &#8220;YouTube is the factory outlet of commercial television, at least for now.&#8221;

He says this because he feels like the big media conglomerates are going to be dumping old television pilots and series that never made primetime, have already been paid for, yet give their network visibility.

We shall see.

Is YouTube the next evolution of TV? Robert seems to think that it is up to us! That is because it is a social network. It ceases to be used when people dont use it.

Thanks Robert for your column!
