Hello all!  
Just a minor makeover of the site. Well, by minor I mean a complete site overhaul coupled with switching web hosts! All in a days work I say!  
I decided to use the K2 skin available from Binarybonsai.com, coupled with Gallery 2.0 available for gallery.menalto.net. They have been coming up with some awesome stuff lately.
