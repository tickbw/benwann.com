Finally got my powerbook re-setup using the latest and greatest from PHP, Apache, and libcurl. (of course all of the other goodness as well)

Here is the order:

  1. **Curl**. If you need a new version of curl and libcurl installed: go here <http://curl.haxx.se>.  
    You will need to compile from source. Important note here: Make sure that you dont have another version of curl that can be read from the $PATH. (This becomes important when compiling PHP in a few minutes) 
  2. **Apache**. Download the source from [httpd-2.2.3.tar.gz][1]  
    Now follow these steps:</p> 
      1. `./configure --enable-mods-shared=all`
      2. sudo make
      3. sudo make install
    
    It is good to note that since I didn&#8217;t specify a prefix (such as &#8211;prefix=/usr/bin/) that the configuration script will choose the default install location (/usr/local/apache2)

  3. **PHP**. Now it is time to compile PHP. Download the source from [here][2] (From the us2.php.net mirror off of sourceforge).  
    Now follow these steps:</p> 
      1. `<br />
./configure<br />
--prefix=/usr/local/apache2/php<br />
--with-zlib<br />
--with-dom=/sw/<br />
--with-libxml-dir=/sw/<br />
--with-xsl=/sw/<br />
--with-jpeg-dir=/sw/<br />
--with-png-dir=/sw/<br />
--with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql/<br />
--with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs<br />
--with-gd<br />
--with-curl<br />
` 
      2. sudo make
      3. sudo make install
    
    It is good to note here, that I had installed a version of curl on my machine and made sure that when I accessed the $PATH, that I was addressing the correct version.

I have done this all before, but each time I do it, I learn something new. Hope this can help someone out there who is banging their head.

Happy compiling!
