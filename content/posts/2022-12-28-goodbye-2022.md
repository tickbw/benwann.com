Goodbye 2022. 

2023 (aka economic winter) is coming, and according to most news outlets, it will be a beast.



To those that are struggling to get by, maybe got laid off, or otherwise, I am sending you a message of hope and comfort for the year ahead. 



May you receive comfort in ways unexpected. Don&#8217;t forget to let the light shine in.



Ben
