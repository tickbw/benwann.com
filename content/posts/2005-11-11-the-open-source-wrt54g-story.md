No doubt I will have to partake in this little hack.  
The hack of the hardware&#8230; it calls to me!

> The story of the Linksys Wireless-G Router (model WRT54G) and how you can turn a $60 router into a $600 router is a little bit CSI and a little bit Freaks & Geeks. Itâ€™s also the story of how the open source movement can produce a win-win scenario for both consumers and commercial vendors. Whatâ€™s especially exciting is that tricking out this router doesnâ€™t require any eBay sleuthing or other hunt for some off-the-wall piece of hardware. Instead, grab it off-the-shelf. The WRT54G is stacked high in every Best Buy and Circuit City across the country and, of course, most online retailers â€” Amazon.com sells it for $55. Itâ€™s ubiquitous and, some would say, a diamond in the rough. Or a wolf in sheepâ€™s clothing.
