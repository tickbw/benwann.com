Whoa Nelly. Eclipse + Zend Studio + IBM = Coding Magic Land

> **Eclipse Foundation, Zend Technologies, and IBM Announce the Approval of the PHP IDE Project**
> 
> A Preview of the New Eclipse PHP IDE is Scheduled at the EclipseCon Conference in Santa Clara
> 
> ECLIPSECON 2006, SANTA CLARA, CA, March 20, 2006â€”The Eclipse Foundation, an open source community committed to the implementation of a universal software development platform, Zend Technologies and IBM, today announced that the Eclipse PHP IDE project has been approved by the Eclipse Foundation. The technology project was proposed by Zend and IBM on October 21, 2005. It will deliver a PHP Integrated Development Environment framework for the Eclipse Platform and will encompass the development components necessary to develop PHP-based Web applications and will leverage the existing Eclipse Web Tools Project.
> 
> â€œEclipse has the goal to create a universal development platform that increases efficiency in enterprise software development,â€ said Mike Milinkovich, executive director of the Eclipse Foundation. â€œThe new PHP IDE project will extend the Eclipse Platform to the world of PHP and will bring two highly successful communities together. Having Zend lead this project will definitely benefit the community. We are looking forward to watching this new project develop, mature and create even more opportunities for users to develop their Web applications.â€
> 
> The Eclipse Platform provides a universal and vendor-neutral, open development environment. The PHP IDE will extend the Eclipse Platform to support development of next generation Web applications in PHP.
