> Whenever there is a computer problem in my family or circle of friends, I&#8217;m the first person they call. It&#8217;s kinda like what Jay-Z describes as the gift and the curse. I&#8217;m gifted to know all of this computer stuff, but I&#8217;m cursed to spend the rest of my life doing tech support for everyone.

> The problem was that it was hard to get people to click on the right things to diagnose the problem over the phone. I spent a lot of time just figuring out basic informaton about their setup before I could actually fix the problem for them. I wanted a way that I could just remote desktop into their computer and while on the phone with them find and fix the problem, and explain what I&#8217;m doing at the same time, so that they understand and can fix it themselves the next time.

> Up until recently there were two ways to do this. You had to install a VNC or Remote Desktop type program on the person&#8217;s machine then forward all of the ports in their router (and hope nobody messes with them). Or you could pay for an expensive service such as gotoassist.com which sets up an online helpdesk.
