It was a close game last night at the Hazelwood Central gymnasium. The McCluer Lady Comets played against their rivals McCluer North. It was a very exciting start to the season with good play all around by the comets, but we still ended up short 47-48 losing at the buzzer. [stltoday.com][1] has this to say about Rachel&#8217;s 2006-2007 Lady Comets.

Watch the Comets throughout the season on this blog, as well as at [maxpreps.com][2]

> McCLUER COMETS
> 
> Vitals: Coach Rachel Wann. 5 letterman, 3 starters, return from a 6-18 team.
> 
> Projected Starting Lineup: Gwen Berry (5-10, sr., G), Khara Harmon (5-4, sr., G), Deja Martin (5-6, jr., G), Anna Struttmann (5-11. sr., F), Kathy Jenkins (5-9, so., F)
> 
> Notes: Wann takes over for Kelly Celeste and will be the youngest coach in the conference. She&#8217;s just two years out of college. &#8230; Wann will have a good group to build around, beginning with Berry (11.6 ppg, 8.1 rpg), who is the team captain and a force inside. &#8230; Ebony Jones (5-11, so., C), Lashae Smith (5-10, sr., F), Jermeeka Hamm (5-7, jr., G) and Tearra Bowers (5-4, jr., G) will get playing time. &#8230; &#8220;We&#8217;re a hard-working team that will run a lot with a great deal of intensity,&#8221; Wann said.</p>
