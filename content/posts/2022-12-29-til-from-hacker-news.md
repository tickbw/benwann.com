[Wireguard][1] is a very interesting technology for creating VPNs. I got interested in them when looking at creating bidirectional tunnels to embedded linux based IoT devices instead of more heavy clients like IPSec and OpenVPN. I did some experimentation with this, but never got very far. It is good to know that this tech is now fully integrated into Linux Kernels 5.6 and higher, so should really see a lot of adoption / migration to this going forward.

I have more recently been very interested in Espressif and their ESP32 platform. Great power and price. Super awesome combo. I hope US and China can work things out and these don&#8217;t get blacklisted like other Chinese chipmakers. 

Over the Hacker News for the daily read, and what do I see:<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">

This is pretty cool. I will probably use this somewhere.
