I have been formulating a goal in my mind to really understand (not invest in) how currencies (both hard and digital) work. I loved this article because it really goes down to the earliest systems that these ATMs and other modern payment systems are built upon. This post had a similar feeling to when I read [&#8220;Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet&#8221;][1] by Andrew Blum. You really get to understand how the digital bits are routed in this book, and this article does the same for ATM transactions.
