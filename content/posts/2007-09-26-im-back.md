Where did IÂ  go you are all asking yourselves!

Well here it is.

I changed the DNS on my ISP to accomodate a client.Â  I did this because my default hosting account does not support php5.Â  I needed php5 for the site I was building for the client.

This was all fine and dandy, except then I forgot to change the DNS back for say, I dont know, 5 months after I was finished.

Whoops!!
