So the Saga of the Coffee + Laptop continued today.

Upon the Computer gaining its heartbeat back, I quickly realized that there were sections of my Hard Drive that had mysteriously disappeared!

So here are the bits of intelligence that I can share with the world.

Long ago, when I first bought my 15&#8243; Powerbook, the Logic Unit failed, not once, but twice.Â  That machine was taken back from Apple, thanks to my purchase of the 3 year Apple Care Protection plan.Â  As this occured right during the transition from PowerPC to Intel based computers, I was offered a brand new MacBook Pro.Â  This was the first release of the machines, in fact they were so new they weren&#8217;t even in the store yet. Â  I would have had to wait for 2 weeks, and as many of you freelance web developers know, that is just not possible.

So I opted for the 17&#8243; PowerBook pimped out to the max.

The problem here, is that I was given an Apple Care Tech Tools Deluxe cd based on my first computer, and was not given a new cd when I received the 17&#8243; machine.Â  Why does this matter?Â  Because when you try to boot your 17&#8243; PowerBook with a 15&#8243; Tech Tool cd, you get a Kernel Panics.

Use this [link][1], to get a disk image (DVD/CD) of the new version of the software.  
Back to the present.

Apple&#8217;s built in Disk Utility did not repair my corrupted hard drive.

Apple&#8217;s Tech Tool Deluxe Volume Repair tool did not fix my corrupted hard drive.

What did the trick?

DiskWarrior 4 from Alsoft.

At $99 this is not necessarily cheap, but it did the trick right away.

I recommend.</p>
