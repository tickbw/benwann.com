MySQL Crash Course  
by John Coggeshall  
12/23/2003

Welcome to another issue of PHP Foundations. Last time, I wrapped up a discussion of an ongoing topic of security and good practices I&#8217;ve dubbed &#8220;PHP Paranoia.&#8221; Today I will be changing gears yet again and discuss a cornerstone of any sizable web application â€” a database back end. Specifically, I will be spending the next few columns discussing the MySQL database, starting with today&#8217;s article, which will serve as a crash course in SQL. For those of you who are familiar with relational databases such as MySQL, today&#8217;s column may not be necessary for you; it contains no PHP code. Instead, I will introduce the concepts of relational databases and the language used to manipulate the data within them. Those of who haven&#8217;t been exposed to relational databases, however, read on!
