> Man&#8217;s mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimensions.  
> &#8211; Oliver Wendell Holmes

Saw this on my Google personalized homepage and it made me think a bit. We all need a little stretching now and again. If we are working on being mentally &#8220;fit&#8221; we will stretch constantly. It is interesting the parallels between the athlete stretching after a hard workout, and this comment by Holmes. The athlete stretches to gain flexibility, and to acheive a higher degree of quickness in the future. The thinker, hopefully all of us not just athletes, needs to be stretched just as much. If we are never stretching, then we are getting Lazy. Lazy thought is the biggest problem in the world today. It is the root of apathy, and the killer of progressive thinking.

Just a thought. Tell me what you think.
